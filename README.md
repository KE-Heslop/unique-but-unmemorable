# unique-but-unmemorable
Unique but Unmemorable: a password generator built with CSS, HTML and Javascript
## Overview
Built as a random password generator to enable employees to generate their own random unique passwords of their preferred length and containing their choice of character types.

When the 'generate password' button is clicked users are presented with a series of prompts.
The user has to imput their choice of the following options:
* Length of password
    * must be at 10 characters but no more than 64.
* Character types (at least one must be selected)
    * Lowercase
    * Uppercase
    * Numeric
    * Special characters 

If the user input is invalid a message is written to the page instead of the card's default 'Generate a password' text

Once all of the prompts are answered the password (and a message not to forget it) is generated and written to the page instead of the card's default (or the previous message if the user had previously inputted incorrectly).

## Instructions
    • Open the generator's deployed URL in a Browser
    • Click the 'Generate Password' button and follow the prompts
